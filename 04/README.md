# Task 04 - Knapsack 0/1 problem solver using Simulated Annealing

-------

Given `n` items, where each item has  `w`(Weight) and `c` (Cost). Find the optimal subset of items to put in the bag of maximum capacity of `M`. Meaning sum of `w` of all items has to be lower or same as `M`. Optimal subset means the subset that maximizes sum of `c`.
